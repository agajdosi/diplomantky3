Home—Topia is an ongoing research and exhibition project putting focus  on current forms of migration, uprooting and life between cultures. Home—Topia examines the notion of home, the sense  of belonging and  its connection to  a physical space. Home—Topia is based on the assumption that different forms of mobility, migration and life on the move have become one of the basic characteristics of today’s world.

The trajectory of the research, bibliography and the documentation of events are available to the public on the home-topia.eu platform.

Among the development of an online platform, the project also includes an author's interactive video installation, implementing the elements of augmented reality. The installation took place in the Raum für Drastische Maßnahmen gallery in Berlin.
