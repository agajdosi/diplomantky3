## About the exhibition 
Diploma exhibitions and catalogues are a specific genre of the art world.
Every year, students and curators have to re-evaluate the meaningfulness of this format.
They alternate between more invasive approaches (modifying the work of the learners for a higher impact of the exhibition as a whole) with approaches that let the diversity and specificity of individual works and disciplines shine through, but at the risk of inconsistent results.
The presentation of FaVU BUT is even more specific in that it simultaneously presents the outputs of free and applied art.

For this year's edition, we, as the curatorial team approached, decided to define this format as a service.
A service leading to an inconspicuous, yet from our point of view important result.
We don't remix the works, we don't come up with flashy architecture, nor do we try to wrap everything in the form of a charming joke or a community gesture.
We look at the exhibition and catalogue in a very utilitarian way, seeking practical outcomes - tools that can serve students after they leave their alma mater.
