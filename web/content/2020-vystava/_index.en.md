## About the exhibition
As designers, we do not want to create a false sense of care for individual graduates in the limited space allocated to us. Therefore, we are not creating a curatorial concept, but a service and infrastructure. A service, a web platform that will be populated by the female graduates themselves. It will survive the physical exhibitions, distributed around Brno in the form of temporary exhibition infrastructure, and we firmly believe that it will survive the graphic trends of the future.

The result is a database/exhibition in 7 locations/7 openings. The vernissages are distributed around Brno from 25 September to 30 September 2020. The exhibitions are open until 30 October 2020. Detailed program and locations of the vernissages, opening hours of the exhibitions and profiles of the graduating artists can be found on the website [www.diplomantky.cz](https://diplomantky.cz), where you are currently located.
