## About the exhibition
Representation is a concept of sign theory. Simply put, it is a certain relation between two entities - that which is represented, the representer, and that which is represented, the represented. It is common to understand works of art as signs whose meaning is subject to interpretation. If works of art represented nothing, they would be impossible to interpret, they would be about nothing, they would be empty, uninteresting. The basis for our participation in this year's exhibition of FaVU graduates is the fact that it is a well-established showcase of all the diploma theses produced at the faculty in a given year. We give up the ambition to evaluate individual theses or to regroup them into new categories and to cover them thematically. The range of individual disciplines represented by studio affiliations and the diversity of approaches with an emphasis on freedom of expression also predicts the freedom of presentation of the most recent thesis.
