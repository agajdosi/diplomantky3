# Transparency of Voice and Light

![](/2021/hejduk/1.jpg)

The content of the thesis is a series of fictional audiovisual stories, inspired by the nocturnal reality of streets, combined with my personal perspective and impression situated in the role of an observer. The stories are created from a large amount of collected audio and video material. The records are post-production linked, thereby depicting an image created by my imagination from a mixture of impressions formed in connection with the observed everyday reality, which becomes a spectacle in my view. The intention is to retell the story of my own experience in the role of a voyeur.

The work does not offer any general solution of expressive elements or burdened topics that appear in the work, such as voyeurism, personal data acquisition and their compromise, or any of the topics discussed in the stories. The work only touches on these topics, works with what is available, and connects individual elements together. It represents a possible principle of transmitting information between people, retelling of lived and unlived experiences and their resulting forms, which often differ from reality.
