# Ace up One's Sleeve

![](/2021/levitnerova/1.jpg)

The title of the master's thesis, "Ace up One's Sleeve," refers to a phrase indicating a successful agreement between two parties. However, the advantage of such a deal may not be mutual. It indicates the balance of success of the participants. In my work, I follow the aspect of corporeality, the distinction between the physical body and textile, the transformational character between a used object, clothing, and free art. The reference to DIY culture, self-sewing, and upcycling serves as an example of disharmony: the juxtaposition of scarcity and surplus.

The plastic "embroidery" in my work represents a series of failures. It's an attempt to question my own skills and rediscover the relationship with traditional crafts techniques. Using a soldering iron, I melt polyester fabric and try to mimic the traditional craft of embroidery. I use the "fire test" method, which determines the organic or synthetic origin of textile material. However, I use this procedure beyond testing for the production of the work itself. In the [digital representation of my textile image](https://yudex.xyz/), I offer the possibility of detailed display and thus allow the viewer's gaze to penetrate into the very structure of the work.

The work is available online at: https://yudex.xyz/.
