# Monad

![](/2021/mucha/1.jpg)

The sculpture "Monad" from the cycle "Harmony" is a 350 cm high steel sculpture composed of welded sheets, which spatially represent harmonic intervals applied to the idealized proportions of a human figure. The impulse is the need for transcendence and meaning in orienting oneself in reality. Creative strategies include reduction, abstraction, and remediation.

My intention was to imprint a large piece of matter with mathematically precisely defined spiritual information. This resulting work will now radiate into the world for as long as possible due to the durability of its material, a message that the universe has structure and purpose, and that every human being is conscious in order to perceive them. That the ability to recognize both makes us one harmonic machine for good, despite all the horrors we commit. According to A. Hogenová, we become what we participate in. The purpose of my work is nothing simpler than to stimulate the viewer's participation in the consciousness of purpose and harmony.
