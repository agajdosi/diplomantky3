# Responsible Design
![](/2021/filipkova/1.jpg)

The project was created with the aim of sharing resources with design students and designers who care about the handling of material resources and who would like to embark on a new, more responsible path, but do not know where and how to start. The output is the online platform [consciousdesign.cz](https://consciousdesign.cz) composed of a freely accessible database of innovative materials, research texts, thematic links, and interviews with designers, material specialists, scientists, and technologists.

The choice of the topic for the diploma thesis mainly arose from reflecting on how to work and operate correctly and responsibly in design practice. The term "sustainable" has become overused - perhaps even misused in recent years. The word "responsible" enriches the concept of sustainability with the context of ethics, meaningfulness of processes, and general consideration. 

Design that deals with ethical issues, reflects on the origin of material resources, and is aware of the impact of its decisions. Design that responsibly and nature-friendly selects, creates, and processes materials can be called responsible design.
