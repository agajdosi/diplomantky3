## About the exhibition
We wish you the strength and support to fulfill your own wishes!
Whether it's marzipan rings, a carousel with swans, blowing out
candles on a cake, a fountain full of wine with eight-meter-long drinking straws,
relaxing in the forest, working for a non-profit organization, going to Indonesia to pick apples or
getting a tattoo in Indonesia, working in a funeral home, pursuing artistic
research, starting your own business, going on a work placement in Germany,
opening a graphic design studio with friends, or starting to work in a
corporation.
We wish you whatever you wish for yourselves!
We wish you strength and enthusiasm, health, love, understanding, support,
closeness, joy, and sparkle.

The curatorial concept of this year's graduate exhibition is defined by
its openness to the individual needs and wishes of the graduates, their
real and diverse applications both within and outside the art world. This
will be followed by a support program for graduates focusing on
the main issues they will face after graduation. The exhibition and
its opening are conceived as a celebration of the completion of studies and the transition to
the next phase of creative, career, and personal growth.
Kate≈ôina Olivov√° and Barbora Trnkov√°
